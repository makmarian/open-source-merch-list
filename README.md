# Open Source Merch List
This repo is meant to make it easier to find merchandise for open source projects and organizations that promote open source software.

This list is continuously updated.

If there is a project or an organizations you think should not be on this list please do a pull request or send me a message.

**NOTE 1:** I've tried to make sure these are the correct and official merch shops, but please double check if you are unsure, and send me a message so I can correct it.

**NOTE 2:** I have not bought from any of these places yet, so I can not say anything about the quality of any of these websites.
